description: Orchestrate enterprise-software-playbook skills end-to-end for enterprise web app work (features/bugs/refactors) in conversational mode. Use when the user wants you to choose and apply the appropriate skills automatically (even if they don’t name them), keeping overhead proportional to the change.

# Workflow (Auto Router)

## Overview

This skill is a workflow orchestrator: it routes work across the other skills in this repo so you can deliver cohesive enterprise web app changes without the user needing to micromanage “which skill to use”.

Default loop: **Define → Standardize → Harden → Verify → Mechanics**.

## Workflow

### 0) Calibrate scope (keep overhead proportional)

Classify the request:

- **Tiny change**: small UI copy tweaks, rename a local variable, fix a typo. No behavior/contract change.
- **Normal change**: touches behavior, boundary semantics, or adds a feature.
- **Big change**: cross-service work, migrations, or changes that affect multiple boundaries/teams.

Rule: only create/expand specs and platform primitives when they reduce future drift for the expected scope.

### 1) Define (what are we building?)

Pick the minimal “definition artifacts” needed:

- For **normal/big** changes, consider using `plan` early to produce an executable task list + verification plan.
- If work changes externally visible behavior (API/WS/event schema, boundary error semantics, auth rules), **use `spec`** first:
  - update the relevant `specs/*.md` and/or `apps/<service>/spec/` bundle
  - update contracts (`contracts/`: OpenAPI/proto/WS docs)
  - write acceptance scenarios and failure-mode expectations
- If the primary pressure is cross-service (partial failures, sagas, event-driven, domain boundaries), **use `architecture`**.
- If the primary pressure is in-process design (construction/structure/behavior), **use `design`**.

### 2) Standardize (make it consistent)

Prevent copy/paste drift:

- If the same boundary behavior repeats across services (timeouts, retries, error mapping, telemetry fields), **use `platform`** and extract a small “golden path” primitive.
- If editing TypeScript, apply `typescript` while implementing (typed boundaries, explicit lifetimes, safe module structure).

### 3) Harden (make it survive reality)

If the change touches I/O boundaries (HTTP/gRPC/DB/cache/queues/events/WS), apply these:

- `resilience`: timeouts + cancellation, bounded retries (only when safe), idempotency/dedupe, breakers/bulkheads when needed.
- `security`: authn/authz checks, strict input validation, secrets/PII safety, and SSRF/injection guardrails where applicable.
- `observability`: log/trace/metric correlation, stable field contract, and local verification steps (log → trace → metrics).

### 4) Verify (prove behavior)

- Use `testing` for non-trivial changes:
  - characterization tests before refactors
  - consumer-visible tests for new behavior and failure semantics
  - avoid asserting implementation details

### 5) Mechanics (in-process building blocks)

Only when implementation needs it:

- Apply a specific in-process pattern via `patterns-creational`, `patterns-structural`, or `patterns-behavioral`.
- Prefer wrappers/facades at boundaries; keep pattern seams small.

## Guardrails

- Don’t create “spec theater”: if the change is tiny, keep docs minimal and move on.
- Don’t skip specs for boundary/contract changes: pin behavior with contracts + tests.
- Don’t introduce retries without idempotency.
- Don’t add telemetry labels with unbounded/high-cardinality values.
- Don’t “helpfully” change response shapes or error semantics unless the spec says so.

## Output Template

When you finish work, report:

- For non-trivial changes, run `finish` before reporting.
- **Skills applied**: which ones you used and why (1 line each).
- **What changed**: behavior + contract impacts + key files touched.
- **Verification**: commands run and results (or why they couldn’t be run).
- **Follow-ups**: optional next tasks (if any).
