description: "Apply behavioral code patterns (classic GoF: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor). Use when you need pluggable algorithms, event-driven updates, request pipelines, undo/redo, decoupled collaboration, state-dependent behavior, or stable iteration over collections."

# Apply Behavioral Patterns

## Overview

Manage algorithms and collaboration without turning your code into nested conditionals and tight coupling. Behavioral patterns help you route requests, encapsulate actions, and swap behavior safely.

A note on scope: these guidelines assume **systemic** TypeScript (long‑lived apps/services). For short‑lived scripts, you can often simplify (fewer abstractions, more `throw`) as long as the blast radius stays small.

## Workflow

1. Decide “scriptic vs systemic” and set policies (error semantics, boundary validation, ownership/lifetimes).
2. Identify the interaction pressure: pipelines, events, undo, state machines, or algorithm selection.
3. Draw a quick responsibility map: who triggers actions, who owns state, who receives outcomes?
4. Pick a pattern that makes responsibilities explicit (interfaces + concrete behaviors).
5. Implement with clear contracts and tests for ordering, error semantics (Result vs throw), and lifetimes (unsubscribe/shutdown).

## Chooser

- **Chain of Responsibility**: configurable pipeline; each handler may handle or pass along.
- **Command**: represent actions as objects; queue/schedule/undo/retry.
- **Iterator**: traverse collections/graphs without exposing representation.
- **Mediator**: central coordinator to reduce many-to-many coupling.
- **Memento**: snapshot/restore object state; undo/redo without leaking internals.
- **Observer**: pub/sub updates; multiple listeners react to events.
- **State**: state machine; behavior varies by state; transitions are explicit.
- **Strategy**: swap algorithms behind a stable interface (runtime/config selection).
- **Template Method**: stable algorithm skeleton with overridable steps (often via hooks; use inheritance only when it already fits).
- **Visitor**: add new operations across a stable object structure without changing element classes.

## Implementation Checklist

- Make ordering explicit for pipelines and observers; define error semantics (what’s expected vs unknown).
- For expected failures, prefer typed unions/`Result`; reserve `throw` for unknown/unrecoverable and catch/convert at boundaries.
- Treat boundary inputs as `unknown` (events/requests) and validate/decode once near the edge.
- For async observers/pipelines, make ownership explicit: unsubscribe/shutdown, backpressure/queueing, and cancellation (`AbortSignal`).
- Keep strategies/states small and pure when possible; inject dependencies via context.
- Prefer composition for Strategy/State; reserve Template Method for cases where inheritance is already a fit.
- For Command/Memento: define serialization and persistence needs early (in-memory vs durable; versioned formats).

## Output Template

When applying a behavioral pattern, return:

- The pressure you’re addressing (pipeline/eventing/undo/state/algorithm selection) and why this pattern fits.
- The proposed seam (interfaces/contracts) and who owns state and lifetimes (subscribe/unsubscribe, start/stop).
- Verification steps (tests for ordering, expected failures, and shutdown/cancellation).
