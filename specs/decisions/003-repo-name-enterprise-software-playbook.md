# Decision 003: Rename Repo To “enterprise-software-playbook”

**Date**: 2026-01-31
**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The original repo name (“the-true-scotsman”) started as an inside joke.

As the repo evolved into an opinionated system for building cohesive, operable enterprise web applications, the name became a source of confusion for new users and for adoption into professional codebases.

## Decision

Use **enterprise-software-playbook** as the repo name and primary branding in documentation and templates.

## Consequences

- Clearer purpose and easier adoption in enterprise environments.
- Existing clones/submodules may need to update their paths and links; the skill folder names remain unchanged and are still treated as API.
