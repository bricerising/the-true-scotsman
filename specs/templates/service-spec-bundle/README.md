# Service Spec Bundle Template

Copy these files into `apps/<service>/spec/` and edit them until they reflect reality.

Files:

- `spec.md`: requirements, acceptance, invariants, decision/measurement artifacts
- `plan.md`: implementation sequencing and risk controls
- `tasks.md`: ordered task checklist with observable acceptance checks
- `quickstart.md`: how to run and verify locally
- `data-model.md`: entities, ownership, storage boundaries
- `contracts/README.md`: contract surface guidance (OpenAPI/proto/events)
