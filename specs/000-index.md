# Specs Index

This folder is the stable “source of truth” for how **the-true-scotsman** is organized and evolved.

Use it to prevent taxonomy drift and to make multi-agent iteration converge.

## How To Use These Specs

- Before adding/renaming a skill, changing terminology, or changing the default workflow, update/add a spec (and usually a decision record).
- Keep specs aligned with `README.md` and `PROMPTS.md`.

## Documents

- `specs/001-skill-library.md`: Charter for what this repo is for (goals, non-goals, constitution, acceptance).
- `specs/002-skill-contract.md`: What a “skill” is in this repo (folder format, metadata, compatibility, validation/packaging).
- `specs/003-taxonomy-and-workflow.md`: The workflow-stage taxonomy (Define/Standardize/Harden/Verify/Mechanics) and how it maps to skills.
- `specs/004-change-process.md`: How to evolve this repo without breaking prompting compatibility or bloating context.
- `specs/tasks.md`: Backlog of work with acceptance criteria.
- `specs/quickstart.md`: Copy/paste commands to validate/package skills locally.
- `specs/decisions/`: ADR-style decision records (see `specs/decisions/000-template.md`).
