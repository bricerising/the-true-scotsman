# Specs Index

This folder is the stable “source of truth” for how **enterprise-software-playbook** is organized and evolved.

Use it to prevent taxonomy drift and to make multi-agent iteration converge.

## How To Use These Specs

- Before adding/renaming a skill, changing terminology, or changing the default workflow, update/add a spec (and usually a decision record).
- Keep specs aligned with `README.md` and `PROMPTS.md`.
