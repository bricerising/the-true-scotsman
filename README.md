# enterprise-software-playbook

This repo is an opinionated set of **agent skills** meant to drive cohesive, high-quality **enterprise software**: readable, maintainable, testable, and safe to change.

Each skill is a small, self-contained playbook (workflow + checklists + examples) stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Most skills are language-agnostic; TypeScript is currently the only language-specific style guide.

## Scope (and non-goals)

This playbook is optimized for **enterprise web apps**, especially:

- HTTP/gRPC services, background jobs, and event consumers
- Multi-service systems with reliability/consistency pressures

Non-goals:

- A framework-specific “how to build a React app” guide
- A complete performance tuning handbook (use it selectively, case-by-case)

## What you get

- A default workflow that keeps changes cohesive: **Define → Standardize → Harden → Verify → Mechanics**
- A small library of composable playbooks (“skills”) that an assistant can auto-apply
  - Skills are supported by coding agents like **Codex CLI** and **Claude Code** (and can be vendored into any repo)
- Copy/paste prompt recipes in [`PROMPTS.md`](PROMPTS.md)
- An adoption template for app repos: [`specs/templates/app-repo/AGENTS.md`](specs/templates/app-repo/AGENTS.md)

## 60-second start

1. Install the skills (pick one): [Codex CLI](#codex-cli), [Claude Code](#claude-code), [Antigravity](#antigravity), or [vendor via submodule](#tool-agnostic-vendor-it-into-your-project).
2. Add agent instructions to your app repo (start from [`specs/templates/app-repo/AGENTS.md`](specs/templates/app-repo/AGENTS.md)).
3. Paste the “Conversational bootstrap” from [`PROMPTS.md`](PROMPTS.md#conversational-bootstrap-auto-route).

You do **not** need to read this repo cover-to-cover. Start with the three steps above, then open the specific `skills/*/SKILL.md` playbook(s) you need as you go.

Minimal “try it now” prompt:

```text
Use workflow (read skills/workflow/SKILL.md).

Please review this enterprise web application.
```

## What’s in here

**Define (what are we building?)**

- [`skills/workflow/`](skills/workflow/SKILL.md): Auto-route work across skills (conversational mode: choose appropriate skills even if the user doesn’t name them).
- [`skills/plan/`](skills/plan/SKILL.md): Turn a request into an executable plan (tasks + acceptance + verification).
- [`skills/spec/`](skills/spec/SKILL.md): Write specs, contracts, plans, and task lists so agents converge on cohesive solutions.
- [`skills/architecture/`](skills/architecture/SKILL.md): Choose the smallest system pattern(s) for cross-service pressures.
- [`skills/design/`](skills/design/SKILL.md): Choose the smallest code pattern(s) for in-process design pressures.

**Standardize (make it consistent)**

- [`skills/typescript/`](skills/typescript/SKILL.md): TypeScript guidance focused on runtime safety, explicit boundaries, typed errors, and maintainable module structure.
- [`skills/platform/`](skills/platform/SKILL.md): Design and evolve a shared platform package (`packages/shared`) without becoming a “utils junk drawer”.

**Harden (make it survive reality)**

- [`skills/resilience/`](skills/resilience/SKILL.md): Timeouts, retries/backoff, idempotency, circuit breakers, bulkheads.
- [`skills/security/`](skills/security/SKILL.md): Authn/authz, input validation, injection safety, secrets, SSRF guardrails.
- [`skills/observability/`](skills/observability/SKILL.md): Logs/metrics/traces correlation, RED metrics, dashboards/alerts, verification steps.
- [`skills/debug/`](skills/debug/SKILL.md): Debug workflows (log → trace → metrics) for incidents, regressions, and SLO violations.

**Verify (prove behavior)**

- [`skills/testing/`](skills/testing/SKILL.md): Consumer-focused tests that raise coverage without asserting implementation details.
- [`skills/review/`](skills/review/SKILL.md): Moderator-led adversarial code review debate (critique → defense → rebuttal → verdict) with strict evidence requirements.
- [`skills/finish/`](skills/finish/SKILL.md): Definition-of-done pass (verification + boundary spot-check + crisp summary).

**Mechanics (in-process building blocks)**

- [`skills/patterns-creational/`](skills/patterns-creational/SKILL.md): Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, and (careful) Singleton.
- [`skills/patterns-structural/`](skills/patterns-structural/SKILL.md): Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.
- [`skills/patterns-behavioral/`](skills/patterns-behavioral/SKILL.md): Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor.

## Using these skills

Each skill lives under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The primary mode is **conversational**: ask for what you want and let the agent auto-select the right skills. If you want deterministic control, name specific skills explicitly.

For more prompt recipes (including a conversational bootstrap), see [`PROMPTS.md`](PROMPTS.md).

## Philosophy

These skills bias toward practices that make codebases easier for humans to operate over time:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness; optimize for the next reader.
- Make boundaries explicit; validate external inputs at the edges.
- Keep dependencies and lifetimes explicit; avoid hidden globals.
- Treat expected failures as data (typed results) instead of exceptions.
- Use design patterns as names for proven structures, not as goals.

## Install & integrate

**Note:** Installation differs by assistant/platform. Codex CLI and Claude Code use different local “skills” directories; Antigravity Kit-style projects load skills from `.agent/skills/`; tool-agnostic assistants often work best by vendoring this repo into the app repo.

This repo is designed to be used directly with **Codex CLI**, but you can also integrate it with other popular code assistants by copying/linking the relevant guides into their “project rules / instructions” mechanism.

### Codex CLI

Codex CLI is OpenAI’s terminal-based coding agent: https://github.com/openai/codex

Tell Codex:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricerising/enterprise-software-playbook/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md
```

Manual install (shell):

1. Clone this repo anywhere you like.
2. Symlink (or copy) the skill folders into `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (commonly `~/.codex/skills`).

Example (symlinks; installs every skill folder in this repo):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bricerising/enterprise-software-playbook.git ~/.codex/enterprise-software-playbook
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
for f in ~/.codex/enterprise-software-playbook/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  ln -s "${f%/SKILL.md}" ~/.codex/skills/
done
```

### Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic’s terminal-based coding agent: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

Tell Claude Code:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricerising/enterprise-software-playbook/refs/heads/main/.claude/INSTALL.md
```

Manual install (shell):

1. Clone this repo anywhere you like.
2. Symlink (or copy) the skill folders into your Claude Code skills directory (commonly `~/.claude/skills`).

Example (symlinks; installs every skill folder in this repo):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bricerising/enterprise-software-playbook.git ~/.claude/enterprise-software-playbook
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for f in ~/.claude/enterprise-software-playbook/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  ln -s "${f%/SKILL.md}" ~/.claude/skills/
done
```

### Antigravity

Antigravity Kit-style projects load skills from `.agent/skills/` in the project root.

Tell Antigravity:

```text
Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricerising/enterprise-software-playbook/refs/heads/main/.antigravity/INSTALL.md
```

Manual install (shell):

1. Vendor this repo into your project (submodule or clone).
2. Symlink `tools/enterprise-software-playbook/skills/*` into `.agent/skills/*`.

### Tool-agnostic: vendor it into your project

Many assistants can only reliably follow rules that live *inside the repo they’re editing*. A simple approach is to add this repo as a submodule (or just copy the files), then point your assistant at the specific skill(s) you want.

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/bricerising/enterprise-software-playbook.git tools/enterprise-software-playbook
```

Then reference files like `tools/enterprise-software-playbook/skills/typescript/SKILL.md` in your assistant’s project instructions.

## Terminology

- **Code patterns**: in-process patterns (classic creational/structural/behavioral patterns, mostly GoF).
- **System patterns**: cross-process patterns (architecture/distributed-systems/ops) that deal with failure, consistency, and integration seams.
- **Operational patterns**: repeatable workflows and cross-cutting policies that make delivery + operations predictable (spec bundles, shared platform primitives, tests, observability, resilience).

The skill list above is grouped by **workflow stage** (Define/Standardize/Harden/Verify/Mechanics), not by scope.

## Feedback

If you try this playbook in a real codebase, feedback is extremely valuable:

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs, confusing docs, and feature requests.
- Include the prompt you used and what you expected vs what happened.
